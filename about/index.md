UseTheSource is a collection of open-source projects related to [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) in a broad sense and [software language engineering](http://www.sleconf.org): languages, libraries, tools, IDEs. See [Projects](../projects/) for the full list. 
The core element of this collection is the [Rascal metaprogramming language](https://www.rascal-mpl.org; it serves as the fundament and the hub -a "one-stop-shop"- for all technology presented here. The general goal of this software is to help software engineers manage the complexity of their code by automating tasks which are hard or cumbersome to do otherwise. On UseTheSource code means everything: _abstract models_, _specifications_, _data files_ and _source code_ -as written in any given software language.
